# Paint Pour Digital Art Generator

![Sample Paint Pour Output](PLACEHOLDER_FOR_MAIN_IMAGE)

## Overview
This project digitally replicates the visual style of "paint pour" artwork, where an artist pours multiple colors of acrylic paint onto a canvas to create beautiful, organic patterns. The program generates aesthetic, filled-contour images using fractal noise, custom colormaps, and optional Voronoi cell overlays, resulting in images that closely resemble real paint pours.

## Intended Audience
This tool is designed for anyone interested in creating wallpapers, backgrounds, or banner art for various digital mediums. The code is written to be readable and accessible to true Python novices, making it a great starting point for beginners who want to experiment with generative art.

## Features
- **Automatic Generation:** Easily create paint pour-style images with a single function call.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Over a dozen variables can be tweaked manually for creative control, or left to be randomly chosen from sensible ranges.
- **Prominent Cells Mode:** The `prominent_cells` option produces a fundamentally different style by manipulating variable ranges, resulting in striking cell-like foreground features.
- **Intermediate Plots:** Optionally display detailed intermediate plots to illustrate the steps of the image generation process.
- **Voronoi Cell Overlays:** Add cell-like structures to simulate effects seen in real acrylic pours.
- **Flexible Saving:** Save images to a specified directory, or simply display them interactively.

## Example Usage
A minimal example to generate a paint pour image:

```python
import paint_pour_tools as pptools

pptools.generate_paint_pour_images(
    image_dimensions=[1920, 1080],
    num_images=1,
    display_final_image=True,
    save_image=True,
    prominent_cells=True
)
```

For more advanced usage, you can specify additional parameters to customize the output.

## Getting Started
1. Install the required Python packages (see below).
2. Run the example script or import the functions into your own project.
3. Adjust parameters as desired to experiment with different styles.

## Installation
This project requires no special installation instructions, aside from several common modules like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scipy.
